## 1. Executive Summary

**Token Name / Symbol:** BITKWANZA (BKZ)  
**Blockchain:** Binance Smart Chain (BSC), optional Ethereum  
**Total Supply:** 1,000,000,000 BKZ  
**Decimals:** 18  
**Token Type:** ERC20/BEP20 with fees, Dividend Vault, and Treasury Strategy  
**Max Transaction Fee:** 2.5%

**Purpose:** BKZ is designed to provide holders with passive rewards through an automated Dividend Vault, ensure liquidity and scarcity through a Treasury Strategy (buyback, burn, liquidity injection), and maintain flexibility for bridges and exchanges with fee exemptions and toggles.

---

## 2. Problem & Solution

### Problem
- Many tokens fail to deliver passive rewards without overcomplicating gas fees.
- Lack of automated treasury strategies leads to liquidity instability and unsustainable tokenomics.

### Solution
BKZ addresses these problems by:
- **Dividend Vault:** Auto-claimable rewards for holders in BKZ or stablecoins (USDC/BUSD).
- **Treasury Strategy:** Controlled buybacks, burns, and liquidity injections.
- **Fee-Exempt & Toggle:** Ensures smooth integration with LPs, bridges, and exchanges.
